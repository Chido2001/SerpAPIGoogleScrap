# SerpAPIGoogleScrap
The program was built based on SerpAPI Google Search Scraping program. Due to heavily based on SerpAPI and it's api_key, it has its pros and cons:
Pros:easily to use, to adjust and extend.
Cons: heavily rely on the SerpAPI's api key, so when the key expire, or server disconected, the alternative solution is a must (replacing key or use different API).
